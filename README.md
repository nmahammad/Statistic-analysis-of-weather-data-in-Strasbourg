# Statistic Analysis of Weather Data in Strasbourg 🌦️

**Assignment:** This project was conducted as part of an academic assignment.

## Project Overview 📊

The **meteo_entzheim.csv** file contains hourly meteorological data recorded at the Entzheim station between **01/01/2012 and 31/12/2020** (source: MétéoFrance). This file is organized in columns corresponding respectively to:

- Year
- Month
- Day
- Hour
- Pressure (hPa)
- Wind Direction (°)
- Wind Speed (m/s)
- Humidity (%)
- Precipitation (mm)
- Temperature (°C)

In the course of this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of this meteorological data. My primary focus was on uncovering the **correlation coefficients** between various weather metrics, providing valuable insights into the relationships within the meteorological dataset.
